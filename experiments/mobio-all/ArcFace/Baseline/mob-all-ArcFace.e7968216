Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /idiap/resource/software/sge/temp/sge-tmpdir.7968216.undefined.d/matplotlib-mo_xge14 because the default path (/idiap/home/hotroshi/.cache/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
